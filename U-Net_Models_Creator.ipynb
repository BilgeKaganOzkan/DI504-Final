    "This class defines a custom loss function that applies a weighted mean squared error (MSE) loss to emphasize the watermark regions in images. The `__init__` method initializes the `WeightedMSELoss` class with a `watermark_weight` parameter, which specifies the additional weight to apply to the watermark regions. The `forward` method calculates the weighted MSE loss between the model's output and the target images, emphasizing the regions identified as watermarks. It takes as input the watermarked images, the output images from the model, and the ground truth clear images, and returns the computed weighted MSE loss. This method computes a mask for the watermark regions using the threshold method, calculates the squared differences between the model's output and the target images, weights these differences according to the mask, and returns the mean of the weighted squared differences. The `watermarkMask` method generates a binary mask that identifies regions where the input and target images differ significantly, assumed to be watermark regions. It takes the watermarked and clear images as input and uses a threshold to decide whether a difference is significant enough to be considered part of a watermark, returning a binary mask of the watermark regions."

The optimizer (Adam) is set up with the specified learning rate, and the learning rate scheduler is configured with the specified step size and gamma. The watermark weight tensor is initialized and moved to the specified device, and the loss function is defined with the watermark weight. The dataset is retrieved from the configuration, and it is split into training and validation sets (80% training, 20% validation). Data loaders are created for both training and validation sets. The training loop iterates over the specified number of epochs. During each epoch, the model is set to training mode, and batch losses are initialized. For each batch of training data, the gradients are zeroed, input and target images are moved to the specified device, the model output is obtained, the loss is calculated, backpropagation is performed, and model parameters are updated. The batch loss is stored. After processing all batches, the scheduler is stepped, and the average training loss for the epoch is calculated and reported using `ray.train.report`."

# Bilge Kağan ÖZKAN U-Net Model for Watermark and Logo Removal: A Comparative Study Project Codes

This project was created by Bilge Kağan ÖZKAN for the DI-504 Foundations of Deep Learning course at METU.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. The PIL library has caused slight degradation when saving images. Therefore, to see the correct versions of the images, please check the `Model_Output_Visualizer.ipynb` file.

2. The ray library in the `U-Net_Models_Creators` file has caused numerous performance bottleneck errors. Every possible solution has been tried to resolve this issue, but none have been successful.

## All Project
This branch only contains the codes, and visualizer outputs. To see and execute the entire project, please refer to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TY-SYlJ43rcFgu-5ZVp9Nf4AUqA4Z0qd?usp=sharing
